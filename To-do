	/ User can view a feed of when and where they connected last
	/ Admin can specify what information they require from a user
	- Allow a user to connect to a place
		/ Dont allow the user to view the account if they have already connected to that account
		/ Make sure the user meets all the required details before they are able to connected.
			/ Did all the logic in the check in function. Need to move it to the add connection function. Just copied and pasted what i had into the other function. Start in checkin controller addConnection();
		/ Allow the user to add the required details as they are trying to connect
			/ Try to rewrite with laravels input::old() and errors methods. Currently a little hackish
		- Little bug with incorrect url when adding required details
			- it is addRequiredDetails needs to be connection-attempt 
	/ Be able to update the user details table.
	- Make sure check in is working with required details currently is not
	- Redirect::intended() for when the user has been requested to login
	- Front end
	- Admin dashboard
